  noteWords: "June 6th \r\nWell, I've finally made it to the Ryse Isles, hopefully
    the seas here are as calm as the wind, I'm writing down my thoughts for further
    reflection and so I can look back on this one day.\r\n\r\nJune 8th \r\nIt's strange
    despite what I was told about great bounty in the Ryse Isles, it seems like the
    fish here are something I've never seen anywhere previously.\r\n\r\nJune 9th
    \r\nThe People at The Colony of Rise are very friendly, and despite not paying
    them much they improved upon my grandfather's design and now I feel I can brave
    these waters ever more.\r\n\r\nJune 12th \r\nLast Night was the first I had stayed
    out on the water, if it had not been for the lighthouse I would have lost myself
    in this ever permeating fog."
