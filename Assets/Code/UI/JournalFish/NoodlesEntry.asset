  journalEntry1: "long thought to be a dangerous three headed snake. I have discovered
    that this \u201Csnake\u201D is harmless and is friendly towards humans.\r\n\nAfter
    observation I have discovered that each head has a purpose.  Red protects the
    body, blue consumes, and yellow observes. \r\n\n"

  journalEntry2: As it turns out the locals of the area call them noodles and play
    a common prank on new travelers to scare them, thier oriental dish is not really
    a good descriptor for these spongy bright coloured entwined.... noodles.
  amountBeforeEntry3: 5
  journalEntry3: Apparently one of the locals had contained a large grouping of them
    in a homemade fish aquarium. After its sudden dissapearance a witness said they
    spotted a large bundle of tendrils propelling themsevles towards the shore.
