  journalEntry1: "It\u2019s a Duck?  With a mermaid tail. I did not know what to
    expect with this. It squeaks when I squeeze it. The duck is very friendly, and
    I occasionally will feed him pellets of food I have lying around the boat.\r\n"
  amountBeforeEntry2: 2
  journalEntry2: After further observation, tales of mermaids are usually about how
    they lure weary sailors to their doom, however I believe this.. thing is fairly
    harmless.
  amountBeforeEntry3: 3
  journalEntry3: On further developments it seems to have the ability to make people
    uncontrollably giggle and laugh, this can lead to accidents and makes the doom
    seem a tad more credible.
