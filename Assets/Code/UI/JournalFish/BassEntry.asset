  journalEntry1: "I thought this would be the common Bass found throughout the world\u2026
    How was I meant to act when I discovered an instument as a fish?  Is it edible?
    How does it breathe?\r\n\n"
  amountBeforeEntry2: 3
  journalEntry2: Even thought it may not look like it the locals say that this fish
    actually was introduced to the area, used to be a sea bass and it acclimated
    to the area in a strange way.
  amountBeforeEntry3: 5
  journalEntry3: The strange tendrils that stretch across seem to make sound, it
    could be that they use this sound underwater to communicate or drive away predators.
