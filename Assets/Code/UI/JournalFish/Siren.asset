  journalEntry1: "A creature of many faces. Or so I thought. This creature is NOTHING
    like the stories I had heard. It\u2019s a weird little fish with a toy like head
    on its tongue. At least I think so? However, it can look very menacing to overlookers.\r\n"
  amountBeforeEntry2: 2
  journalEntry2: Locals revealed that this creature actually uses the head as a tool
    to ward off other predators and to lure in sailors who see a drowning woman,
    how sinister
  amountBeforeEntry3: 3
  journalEntry3: The Locals omitted the part where it doesnt harm anyone it lures
    in, just presents its mouth for easy food once sailors fall for the trap
