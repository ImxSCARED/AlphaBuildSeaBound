  journalEntry1: "I have started learning that even in these deeper waters. There
    is nothing to be afraid of. Only bigger creatures live down there. And they all
    mean no harm. I hope so at least. This Sea....horse? Is beautiful and has scales
    that can make even the dullest coat shine. \n"
  amountBeforeEntry2: 2
  journalEntry2: After close analysis it has a great depth of emotion and facial
    reaction, unlike a usual equine, it whines at my light prodding of its features.
  amountBeforeEntry3: 3
  journalEntry3: I am yet to discover more about this creature, It still requires
    more observation.
